# BlackBox-V2-Arduino
total rewrite of my original BlackBox software. Uses new libraries to limit memory usage and improve functionality. Code was written in 2016, uploading now for the sake of my portfolio  Software for a data logger I built using arduino. Logs accelerometer and GPS data together to track movement data over a period of time, potentially to be used as an overlay for go-pro videos or just to view maximum accelerations and speeds for action sports
